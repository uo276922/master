00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Our project is oriented towards the development and implementation of a digital twin in the manufacturing process,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
especially for the validation

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of the smoking processes of sausages.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and other cured meat products.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So one of the main challenges is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the variability of the production and also food safety control.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
With our solution, the microbiological control

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is better controlled.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Our system allows predicting how many days

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
are needed for the product to be ready

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and safe and free from the risk of microbiological contamination.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Another challenge is the traceability of the product

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
through the whole smoking process.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We have developed several innovations.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
One of the main innovations is the approach

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because it's the first known case of application of a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
digital twin to our traditional food processing.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Also at a technological and research level,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we have developed machine-learning models

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to correlate environmental parameters to

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
critical control points within our process.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We are applying these models and algorithms

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to other processes.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
S3FOOD enabled us to perform all these research activities.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
As we are a company, if we don't have funding,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we're not able to make research.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So, funding is essential for us to develop new products.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The next step beyond this project,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we want to install a program on CO2 and CO2 sensors

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to monitor the fire consumption and smoke production.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It will give us more reliability about the process.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and also to install and program sensors for weight monitoring,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to have a more precise idea about how the process is going

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and make more reliable predictions.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We are now taking this knowledge we have acquired

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
with this project

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
- all the knowledge and advice we have had along the way â€“

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and we are applying it to other projects

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
related to digital twins and digitalization
