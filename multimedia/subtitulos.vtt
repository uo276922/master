Our project is oriented towards the development and
0:13
implementation of a digital twin in the manufacturing process,
0:17
especially for the validation
0:20
of the smoking processes of sausages.
0:25
and other cured meat products.
0:27
So one of the main challenges is
0:30
the variability of the production and also food safety control.
0:36
With our solution, the microbiological control
0:40
is better controlled.
0:43
Our system allows to predict how many days
0:49
are needed for the product to be ready
0:56
and safe and free from risk of microbiological contamination.
1:03
Another challenge is the traceability of the product
1:07
through the whole smoking process.
1:13
We have developed several innovations.
1:16
One of the main innovations is the approach
1:21
because it's the first known case of application of a
1:26
digital twin to our traditional food processing.
1:29
Also at a technological and research level,
1:32
we have developed machine-learning models
1:38
to correlate environmental parameters to
1:42
critical control points within our process.
1:46
We are applying these models and algorithms
1:50
to other processes.
1:55
S3FOOD enabled us to perform all these research activities.
2:01
As we are a company, if we don't have funding,
2:07
we're not able to make research.
2:13
So, funding is essential for us to develop new products.
2:20
The next step beyond this project,
2:24
we want to install a programme on CO2 and CO2 sensors
2:31
to monitor the fire consumption and smoke production.
2:38
It will give us more reliability about the process.
2:45
and also to install and programme sensors for weight monitoring,
2:51
to have a more precise idea about how the process is going
2:55
and make more reliable predictions.
2:57
We are now taking this knowledge we have acquired
3:01
with this project
3:04
- all the knowledge and advice we have had along the way â€“
3:08
and we are applying it to other projects
3:11
related to digital twins and digitalisation
